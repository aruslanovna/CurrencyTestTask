a. Create a console application that take two currency codes and one amount as input. The
amount is in the first currency. The program should calculate the currency amount for the
second currency code (using the latest exchange rates). The program should do the
calculation in process and not utilize any external calculation api.

b. Extend the program with an optional input date, do the same calculation as in step 1 but use
the currency rate for the date inputted to the program. You need to find out the url for
retrieving exchange rate a given date using the documentation on fixer.io.
